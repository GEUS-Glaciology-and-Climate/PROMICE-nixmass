## Test script to calculate snow water equivalent for Promice QAS stations using the library nixmass
# The library is documented in the paper "Snow Water Equivalents exclusively from Snow Heights and their temporal Changes: The âˆ†SNOW.MODEL" (Winkler, 2020)

# Unresolved issues:
# Are the physical parameters subject to calibration? If so, how to determine and change these?
# Do the results fit with observational data?
# Is HeightSensorBoom the vertical distance from a fixed point to the snow surface?
# 2 requirements for data: first data point has to be 0 and data can not be negative. Solution: find local minimum for each melt season, and calculate until next minimum
